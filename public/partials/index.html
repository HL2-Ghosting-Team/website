		<h1>Ghosting</h1>
		<p>
			Ghosting is a modification to
			<a href="http://source.valvesoftware.com/">Source Engine</a> games.
			It began with Half-Life 2 and has expanded to other Source Engine
			games since. It allows one to capture a speedrun in a source engine
			game and play it back or analyze it later.
